A medicine is a drug or a combination of chemicals used to diagnose, cure, treat, or prevent disease.
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
We are not consuming the correct medicine a particular diagnosed disease and even if we try to consume, we cannot be through that the particular medicine is going to cure that particular disease. 
EXISTING SOLUTION:
The existing solution is the common tablets in the market which treat a wide range of medical conditions. However, when we take a pill to treat a headache, or when we get vaccinated to prevent ourselves getting a disease. So, the medicines present in the market will contain more chemicals than actually required by the body. Which may lead to toxicity and may affect the body in many ways and also, we are not able to know the contents of the medicine.
PROPOSED SOLUTION:
So, this problem can be solved if we locally produce the medicines with help of 3D printers by supplying the cartridges of the required chemical. The diagnosed report of the patient is supplied. Through collected drugs data, persons age, allergic reactions etc. will produce the report on what drugs he must consume. This will be fed to the 3D printer and the required body drug is prepared. Along with it the UI contain a chatbot to check if your diagnosed disease is correct by giving the disease input it tells out the symptoms of such disease.
